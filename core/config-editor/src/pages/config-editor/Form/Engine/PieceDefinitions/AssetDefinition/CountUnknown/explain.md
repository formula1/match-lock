You have the option to set specific counts or a count range. Specifying a count will validate the number of files of this asset type. This can be useful for assets that are expected to have a specific number of files.

Use `*` for the count if any amount of files of this asset count is acceptable. This works for a specific count as well as the maximum of a count range.

By using a specific value, the count is expected to be exactly that value unless `*` is used which allows any number of files.

By using a range of values, any number of files within that range is acceptable. A range can have a minimum of `0` files and a maximum of `*` which allows any number of files.
