Personal pieces are designated lists for each player. While normally each user would select their own list, it is possible to ignore a user's selection and give them a list created by an algorithm. One such example is if all players would recieve random each time.

### Example
In a 3v3 tag team match each player chooses 3 characters which will then be downloaded and used

**Note**: A validation script can be used to validate a player's individual selection. For example, if a game requires each player to select a unique character, a validation script can be used to check for duplicates.

**Note**: If a merge script is used in the selection config, it can overwrite one or all of one or more player's selections. A merge script takes in each player's choices and returns a new set of choices for each player.

**Note**: Personal pieces are selectable by each player. They are not downloaded if not selected.
