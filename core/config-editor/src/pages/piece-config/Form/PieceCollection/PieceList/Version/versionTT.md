# Versions

These are mandatory, uneditable parts to the piece. Each version is based on the hash of the files that make up that part of the piece.

- Logic - The logic version decides what the piece does in game. Changing files such as speed, health or hitboxes are expected to change the logic version. Changing any logic related file makes the game piece considered a completely new piece.
- Media - The media version decides what the piece looks and sounds like. Changing files such as sprites, 3d models, animations or sounds are expected to change the media version. Changing any media related file makes the game piece considered a new version of the same piece.
- Docs - The docs version is mostly just for files that don't effect what the piece does or what it looks like. For example, a readme file or a license file.
