#### Assets that are missing files

> This is an issue because your engine expects these assets to be present. Without them, the piece may not work correctly.

**Possible Reasons**

- In the engine, the related piece definition's asset count is incorrect and a range starting at zero was expected
- In the engine, the related piece definition's asset globs are incorrect and does not match any files
- the file is missing from the folder
