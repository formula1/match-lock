### Assets that have an invalid number of files

> This is an issue because your engine expects a specific number or range of files for this asset.
> The files may be necessary for the piece to work correctly.

**Possible Reasons**

- In the engine, the related piece definition's asset count is incorrect and does not match the number of files
- In the piece folder, there are the wrong number of files for this asset
