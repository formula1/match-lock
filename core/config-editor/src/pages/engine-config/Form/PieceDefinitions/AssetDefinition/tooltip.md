Assets are one or more files that serve a singular purpose.
A single piece is expected to have multiple files. Each of these files are expected to serve a purpose.

For example, a character may have a spritesheet, a skeleton file and an animation file.

Each of these files serve a different purpose and should be defined as a seperate asset.

However, if a character has multiple spritesheets that serve the same purpose, they should be defined as a single asset.
