The asset classification is important for versioning. `Document` changes don't effect the character and thus don't require a version bump. `Media` changes require a patch version bump as they don't generally change the balance of the character, just what the user sees or hears. `Logic` changes require a major version bump as they can change the balance of the character. MatchLock collects the hash of all the `Logic` files to identify a character allowing changes to `media` and `document` files without redownloading the character.

If you are unsure of what a asset type should be, choosing `Logic` is the safest bet.
