Part of piece defintions is specifying what files should be in a piece.
For example a stage may have background music which can be an `.mp3` `.wav` or many other valid file types.
Another example is a character may have a spritesheet which is a `.png` or a `.webp` file.

To support these cases, you can use a "glob" to specify the valid file types.
A glob is a pattern that can match multiple file types.
For example, `*.mp3` will match all files that end with `.mp3`.
You can also specify multiple globs by separating them with a comma.
For example, `*.mp3,*.wav` will match all files that end with `.mp3` or `.wav`.

In addition, glob supports folder structure
