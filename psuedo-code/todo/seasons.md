# Seasons (Adding pieces over time)

Having one gigantic match-restriction config is not scalable.
What we can do instead is have the match-restriction to have patches over time which will add pieces.
This way when a user specifies a piece, they get to specify a patch rather than downloading every piece

One issue is when there is a need to remove a piece the patch where it was introduced must be modified
