At the moment, my target platform is Ikemen-Go.

Ikemen-Go may have a concept of "shared assets" that are used across multiple characters. For example, the default system.sff file is used by all characters.

However, the shared assets I was planning for is something more similar to warcraft 3 having shared models but different skins

As a result, I am not going to worry about shared assets at the moment.
