I'm attempting to create a system for when there's more available choices for a game than is reasonable to completely download. Like 1000s of options when realistically only 100 are used by an individual (Initially). In addition, we create a system where restriction configs are created so that players can play a balanced game instead of playing against over powered choices.

- scanning a folder of pieces that wasn't setup by the system and creating a legend that the system can use. This is done so that we don't require pieces to use our system to be considered valid
- ensuring a player can matchup with other players who all agree to use the same restriction config
- Validating each player's selection with the restriction config
- Downloading any missing pieces necessary

At the moment I'm calling the system "MatchLock".
